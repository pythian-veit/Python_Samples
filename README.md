 genric_anniv.py- I wrote this for a customer to generate unique coupon codes in their data mart database for users on their anniversary month (joining the ecommerce site), loads them into their ecommerce DB, and send the users and their codes to Sales Force Marketing Cloud so the customer can email them the codes.  The database and table names have been changed to annonymize the company.
